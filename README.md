# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# Technology used 

ReactJs 
Redux for state management
antd as React UI design library
Redux Saga for the asynchrounous stuff

# architecture & structre

i used an injection dependcy strategy to make the code more clean, so we have the first part in the app where we have the design stuff and we can call the traitment with dispatch to use sagas function and update the state.
